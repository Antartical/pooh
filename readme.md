## Pooh in a nutshell
the 100 acres wood is a book composed by different pages. Those pages are lost in the wood and the one who has collected them
is Winne the pooh. He also tries to collect information about our different services, so he will update this repo as long as he get
new information about them.

## Services

  - **Pelipper**: have you ever heard about pelipper? yes, obviously. If you are tired of compose emails or sms in your own services maybe you want to move to pelipper. It is a servise through the one you can deliver notifications to your users.
    - repo: https://github.com/Antartical/pelipper
    - docs: [pelipper docs](/pelipper/readme.md)
  - **Gandalf**: are you boring to implement the same authentication system in your services? let's go use gandalf to manage your user outside your core application, it's a miscroservice based on oauth2.
